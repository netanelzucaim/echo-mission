# Patched drop-in replacement for `nginx:1.25-bookworm`

Work in progress. Sections are added as each step of the assignment is completed.

## Baseline

The original image was scanned with Trivy and Grype (`make scan-baseline`).
Reports and image metadata are in `scans/baseline/`.

| | Trivy 0.75.0 | Grype 0.120.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Findings | 775 | 751 |
| Unique CVEs | 494 | 471 |
| Critical | 20 | 47 |
| High | 181 | 253 |
| With a fix available | 342 | 336 |

Image: nginx 1.25.5 on Debian 12.5, linux/amd64,
`nginx@sha256:a484819eb60211f5299034ac80f6a681b06f89e65866ce91f356ed7c72af059c`.

## Finding: the scanners miss nginx's own CVEs

Neither scanner reports nginx's own vulnerabilities in the baseline. Trivy lists nothing
against the `nginx` package. Grype lists three entries (CVE-2023-44487, CVE-2009-4487,
CVE-2013-0337), all of which Debian marks as "not fixed" or "won't fix".

**Why.** Trivy and Grype do not inspect code. They read the installed package list
(name and version) and compare it with a vulnerability database. Both correctly detect
the OS as Debian 12, so they check every package against Debian's security data
(Grype labels each match `debian:distro:debian:12`). That is right for the ~140 Debian
packages, but the `nginx` package in this image is not Debian's:

| Source | nginx version on bookworm | Maintained by |
|---|---|---|
| Debian | 1.22.1 (`1.22.1-9+deb12uN`) | Debian, security fixes backported onto 1.22 |
| nginx.org (used by the original image) | 1.25.5 (`1.25.5-1~bookworm`) | NGINX |

The package list does not record which repository a package came from, so the scanners
treat `nginx 1.25.5-1~bookworm` as a Debian package and compare its version with
Debian's fixed versions.

**Example, CVE-2024-7347** (mp4 module over-read):

- Debian fixed it in `1.22.1-9+deb12u2` by backporting
  ([Debian security tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-7347)).
- Upstream nginx fixed it in 1.27.1, so upstream 1.25.5 is vulnerable.
- The scanner compares `1.25.5` > `1.22.1-9+deb12u2` and concludes "fixed". False negative.

The three CVEs Grype does report fit this explanation: they have no fixed version in
Debian's data, so there is no version to compare and they match any nginx.

Only CVE-2024-7347 was checked against the Debian tracker. The same mechanism is
assumed, not verified, for the other nginx CVEs.

**Consequences for this project.**

- nginx's own CVEs have to be triaged from the
  [nginx security advisories](https://nginx.org/en/security_advisories.html),
  not from the scan reports.
- A backported nginx fix may show no before/after difference in the scan diff, which
  would leave the VEX document nothing to suppress. This can only be confirmed once
  the patched image is built and rescanned.

**Why not just use Debian's nginx package.** It is 1.22, a downgrade from 1.25 that
lacks features the original has (HTTP/3, for one), so it would not be a drop-in
replacement, and the assignment asks for a package built from source. Debian's
backported patches for 1.22 are public and are a useful reference when writing the
backport for 1.25.

## Image configuration: what matches the original and what does not

The assignment requires the filesystem layout, user, working directory, ports and
entrypoint to match the original exactly. The `Containerfile` copies those, and also
the settings the assignment does not name, so the image behaves as a drop-in replacement.
All values were taken from `scans/baseline/inspect.json` and `scans/baseline/history.txt`.

| Setting | Original | This image |
|---|---|---|
| User | root, with `nginx` user/group (UID/GID 101) for workers | Same |
| Working directory | Not set | Same |
| Exposed port | 80/tcp | Same |
| Entrypoint | `/docker-entrypoint.sh` | Same (script extracted unchanged, in `entrypoint/`) |
| Startup scripts | Four files in `/docker-entrypoint.d/` | Same (extracted unchanged) |
| Command | `nginx -g "daemon off;"` | Same |
| Stop signal | `SIGQUIT` (graceful shutdown) | Same |
| Environment | `NGINX_VERSION`, `NJS_VERSION`, `NJS_RELEASE`, `PKG_RELEASE` | Same |
| Label `maintainer` | `NGINX Docker Maintainers <docker-maint@nginx.com>` | **Changed**, see below |

### Deliberate differences

- **`maintainer` label.** Set to `Netanel Zucaim <netanelzucaim100@gmail.com>`.
  This image is rebuilt and patched by me, not by the NGINX maintainers, so keeping
  their name on it would misstate who is responsible for it. The label is metadata
  only and nothing functional depends on it.

### Open decisions

- **Dynamic modules.** The original installs five packages: `nginx` plus the xslt,
  geoip, image-filter and njs modules. Whether to build or drop the four modules is
  not decided yet. If njs is dropped, `NJS_VERSION` and `NJS_RELEASE` will be removed
  from the environment as well.
